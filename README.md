# NGEE-T fates repository
------------------------------

This is the public repository of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment Tropicsâ€™ (NGEE-T) model: the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES).

For more information on the scientific background of FATES, see here:  https://github.com/NGEET/fates-release/wiki/FATES-release-background

For access to the development repository for FATES, please contact Charlie Koven, Rosie Fisher (rfisher at ucar.edu) or Ryan Knox. The development repo is currently private but access for interested parties is typically granted very quickly. 


## Important:
------------------------------

**Most users should not need to directly clone this repository.  FATES needs to be run through a host model, and all supported host-models are in charge of cloning and loading the fates software.**

FATES has support to be run via the Accelerated Climate Model for Energy (ACME) and the Community Earth System Model (CESM).

The NGEE-T project maintains a mirror of CLM.  That software system will automatically pull in the FATES software, and is where most users should go to clone the code:
